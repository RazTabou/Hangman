# --- FUNCTION 1 ---
# Write a function that checks if the player has won.
# The player wins when there are no more letters in the hidden_letters set.
# Return True if won, False otherwise.

def check_win_condition(hidden_letters):

# --- FUNCTION 2 ---
# Write a function that checks if the player has lost.
# The player loses when attempts_remaining reaches 0.
# Return True if lost, False otherwise.

    return attempts_remaining == 0


# --- FUNCTION 3 ---
# Write a function that checks if the game is over (either won or lost).
# Use the previous two functions.
# Return True if game is over, False otherwise.
